Hi!
This bot is made for the discord chatting platform
It was made to solve a problem me and my friends kept encountering when sharing video posts from sites such as reddit.
The thumbnail of the video does not activate the video, and we have to press the link and watch the video from within the shared site.
This bot is made with the Playwright framework in order to extract the video from said site and repost it as a video directly into our Discord chat.
(Activation requires my Discord developer Key, talk to me about it if interested)
